# Helper Tools

Some simple tools in one file for handling:

- Browser Notifications
- Calculating ratings data (votes on a question, for example)
- Getting question, answer, comment, or rating data
- Listening on new ratings
- Getting a user name or ID
- Making a truly scalable image tag. This one generates a temporary image using the canvas API and maintains the layout of a component
