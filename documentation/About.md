# What Is "Amorrius"?

Amorrius is a platform for [Twitch](http://twitch.tv) users to enjoy the Twitch experience in a better or different way. Twitch streamers and viewers get a better to interact, and the viewing experience is pretty dope as well.

Have a question for you favorite streamer? Ask them and receive and answer.

Don't know what game to play on stream today? Make a poll for your viewers to vote on.

Like to play with viewers? Game Queue makes it easy to track who to play with next and who's already played.

Want to check out a streamer later, but you don't want to spend a follow on it just yet? Bookmark them!

And other smaller features, like being able to refresh the chat or video independently, and getting a timestamped video link if you're watching a VOD.

Amorrius is a SPA (Single-Page Application) so you don't need to worry about page refreshes. This means you won't be disconnected from your favorite streams while navigating the app.

# What Does "Amorrius" Mean?

I picked several Latin words (courtesy of Google Translate) to mean close to what's relevant to the app.
- Amicus - "friend"
- Torrens - "Stream" (of wealth, quantity)
- Penitus - "interact"
